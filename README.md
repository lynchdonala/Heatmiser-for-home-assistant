# Heatmiser-for-home-assistant

An integration for [Home Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io/) to add support for [Heatmiser's Neo-Hub and 'Neo'](https://www.heatmiser.com/en/heatmiser-neo-overview/) range of products.

This is a work in progress for adding Heatmiser Neo-hub support to Home Assistant (https://home-assistant.io/), I maintain this as a weekend project only so don't expect fast updates but feel free to raise issues as needed.

# Documentation

Full documentation is available here - [Heatmiser for Home Assistant](https://mindrustuk.github.io/Heatmiser-for-home-assistant/)

## Change log

[Change Log](https://github.com/MindrustUK/Heatmiser-for-home-assistant/blob/dev/docs/changelog.md)

# Known issues - Read me first!

- Heatmiser have labeled the primary API used by this integration as "Legacy API". Please see [Troubleshooting](#troubleshooting) for further details.
- Support for adding Token based authentication is present in the underlying noehubapi and will be coming to this plugin natively at a future date.
- Note specifically the NeoStat WiFi device does not have an API, and so cannot be used with this (or any) NeoHub-based integration.
- Neoplug devices are broken in the dev and 1.5 branch and are due to be fixed as soon as I get a chance to look into the details.

If anyone from Heatmiser is reading; some more devices to build out a more complete hardware test suite to ensure
coverage would really help the project. Feel free to reach out if you want to help with this.
