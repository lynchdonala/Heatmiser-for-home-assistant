## 20241030

- Merged https://github.com/MindrustUK/Heatmiser-for-home-assistant/pull/203 - Improves diagnostics, thanks ocrease.

## 20241028

## 20241024

- Merged https://github.com/MindrustUK/Heatmiser-for-home-assistant/pull/191 - Should cleanup dev branch.

## 20241023

- Merged https://github.com/MindrustUK/Heatmiser-for-home-assistant/pull/190 - Should improve hold behaviour.

## 20241022

- Merged https://github.com/MindrustUK/Heatmiser-for-home-assistant/pull/187 should re-introduce version 1 style hold behaviour for timers.

## 20241021

- Updating README.md with improved troubleshooting steps.

## 20241020

- Change hold service behaviour for: https://github.com/MindrustUK/Heatmiser-for-home-assistant/issues/185

## 20241018

- Bumped dependency on neohubapi to 2.2, hopefully addresses wireless sensor behavior and repeaters in issue: https://github.com/MindrustUK/Heatmiser-for-home-assistant/issues/176

## 20241016

- Version 1.5 Release to Main
  - Current Main branch archived to branch Version 1.0
  - Version 1.5 is a fork of the dev branch with the additional hold controls removed. This has been done as the main
    branch is stale and prompting lots of reports for things fixed up stream that haven't made it to main yet. This should
    satisfy many requirements reported or requested recently.
  - Known issues: Heatmiser Neo Plug functionality is broken. I've made the call that the benefits of getting this
    released even with the missing functionality outweighs the missing element. For anyone who desperately needs support
    for the Neo Plug, please use the Version 1.0 branch. This is the top thing on my list to fix at present.

## 20241013

- Allow calling hold service with float temperatures: https://github.com/MindrustUK/Heatmiser-for-home-assistant/issues/175

## 20241003

- Fixes following previous work to avoid entities being added twice when multiple instances of the integration are in use.

## 20240928

- Multiple fixes and enhancements relating to issue: https://github.com/MindrustUK/Heatmiser-for-home-assistant/issues/170 - Multiple Hubs / Instances should now work.
- **Breaking changes:** Unique IDs are now generated based on serial number, this will cause duplicate entries and a bunch of breakage. Please remove and re-add the integration to clear any issues with this.
- Added support for device serial numbers to ensure device ID's are more distinct when multiple hubs and instances of the integration are in use.
- Serial numbers now report in device info.
- Heatmiser NeoHub now appears as a device. The Serial Number is a placeholder for now. Longer term I'll make this configurable or hopefully Heatmiser will add some API support.
- Heatmiser NeoHub does not have a 'real' serial number, issue raised with Heatmiser here: https://dev.heatmiser.com/t/no-method-to-retrive-serial-nubmer-for-neohub-in-api/1298
- Added Heatmiser NeoHub types / models to constants.
- Report Heatmiser NeoHub type / model in device info.
- Relationships between Heatmiser devices and the Hub now work (via_device).
