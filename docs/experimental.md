# NeoStat HC

NeoStat HC thermostats can be configured to heat and/or cool. By default they also always have a fan mode. If the physical installation of the device does not support some modes, you can use the Configure option on the hub entry to override the available modes for each device. This only applies to NeoStat HC thermostats.
